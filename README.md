Known Issues
============

* If you are getting errors such as "API Error 0021: Unexpected API Failure - need more than 0 values to unpack", 
    that means xmlrpc-c and auditor were not compiled with the same standard library. Also make sure that you remembered to use
    "--enable-libxml2-backend" when running "./configure" on xmlrpc-c.
